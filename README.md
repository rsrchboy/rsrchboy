### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

To find out more about me, visit:

* My blog, at https://weyl.io
* GitLab, at https://gitlab.com/rsrchboy

While I still use GitHub for forks and (most) existing projects, I tend to create new projects and repositories at GitLab.  In particular, I tend to be very CI-driven, and for some time now GitLab has had a _fantastic_ CI/CD system.

<!--

ADD:

* links to GitLab repos of note, e.g. https://gitlab.com/rsrchboy/terraform-provider-gitlabci

**rsrchboy/rsrchboy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
